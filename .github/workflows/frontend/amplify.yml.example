# AWS Amplify Build Specification Example

# This is an example amplify.yml file that shows how to configure
# AWS Amplify to use the build artifacts from S3 that were created
# by the GitHub Actions workflow.

The baseDirectory is set to . and files include .next/standalone/**/*, which will work for extraction but won't align with how Next.js standalone actually runs. The standalone output contains a server.js at .next/standalone/server.js, but for deployment you typically need this at the root. Update this example to either match the nested ZIP structure with proper server startup configuration, or document that the ZIP should be flattened to match standard Next.js standalone deployment patterns.Copilot uses AI.

  # Cache configuration (optional, can be empty since build is from S3)
  cache:
    paths: []

# Environment variables that should be set in Amplify Console
# These are examples - set actual values in Amplify Console under:
# App settings → Environment variables
#
# S3_BUCKET_NAME: your-bucket-name
# NODE_ENV: production
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: https://api.your-domain.com

# Alternative Configuration: Simple Node.js Server
# If you want to run the Next.js standalone server directly:
#
# frontend:
#   phases:
#     preBuild:
#       commands:
#         - aws s3 cp s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME}/builds/frontend-build-latest.zip build.zip
#         - unzip -q build.zip
#     build:
#       commands:
#         - echo "Starting Next.js server..."
#   artifacts:
#     baseDirectory: .
#     files:
#       - '**/*'
#   cache:
#     paths: []

# Notes:
# 1. Make sure to set S3_BUCKET_NAME as an environment variable in Amplify
# 2. The IAM role for Amplify must have permissions to read from the S3 bucket
# 3. For custom domains, configure them in Amplify Console under Domain Management
# 4. For HTTPS, Amplify automatically provisions SSL certificates
# 5. For custom headers, configure them under Rewrites and redirects
